# Go Fn Development Kit (FDK)

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/fnproject/fdk-go?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/fnproject/fdk-go)

fdk-go provides convenience functions for writing Go fn code

For getting started with fn, please refer to https://github.com/fnproject/fn/blob/master/README.md

# Installing fdk-go

```sh
go get github.com/fnproject/fdk-go
```

or your favorite vendoring solution :)

# Examples

For a simple getting started, see the [examples](/examples/hello) and follow
the [README](/examples/README.md). If you already have `fn` set up it
will take 2 minutes!

# Advanced example

TODO going to move to [examples](examples/) too :)
